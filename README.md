# A simple JavaScript that matches Quizlet cards.

# How to use
1.) Open a Quizlet micromatch game <br>
2.) Open the console, paste and run the script <br>
3.) Set the time you want to achieve and start the game<br>

Only tested in Chrome v81.0.4044.138

*Apparently Firefox is the only browser where the code doesn't work.*

Note: the script only works in micromatch mode which is NOT equal with match. (For example: https://quizlet.com/507902727/micromatch)

Also note that Quizlet can't save a time less than 0.5s

# This script was created for learning JS only. I do NOT encourage anyone to use it to ruin other people's experience!

Note: the script can't solve games where you need to pair text with image
