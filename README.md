# A simple JavaScript that matches Quizlet cards.

# How to use
1.) Open a Quizlet micromatch game <br>
2.) Open the console, paste and run the script <br>
3.) Set the time you want to achieve and click "OK"<br>

Note: the script only works in micromatch not match. (For example: https://quizlet.com/507902727/micromatch)

Also note that Quizlet can't store a time less than 0.5s

# This script was created for learning JS only. I do NOT encourage anyone to use it to ruin other people's experience!

Note: the Old version of the script can't achieve a time less than 2.5s
