# A simple JavaScript that matches Quizlet cards.

# How to use
1.) Open a quizlet micromatch game <br>
2.) Open console, paste and run the script <br>
3.) Click on 'Start game' button <br>

Note: the script only works in micromatch not match. (For example: https://quizlet.com/507902727/micromatch)

# This script is was created for learning JS only. I do NOT encourage anyone to use it to ruin other people's experience!

Note: so far I couldn't find a way to make it faster than 2.5s.
